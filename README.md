# TinyWare

TinyWare is a minimalistic Linux "distribution" mostly used for testing
kernels. It runs entirely out of initramfs and boots to the BusyBox shell
without a login prompt. It has no networking or display capability. Currently,
the only supported platforms are the BeagleBone Black and QEMU x86_64 virtual
machines.

The artifacts build in as little as 3 minutes, and boot in as little as 2
seconds!

The BeagleBone image exposes a USB Mass Storage endpoint for sharing files
between a development machine and the target, and the QEMU build accomplishes
the same using `virtfs`.

# Building an Image

Building is supported on both x86_64 and aarch64 hosts.

First, build the development OCI. This image contains the cross compilation
tools necessary to build the kernel and supporting packages for the BeagleBone
platform.

```bash-session
$ buildah bud -t kernel-factory:latest Containerfile
```

Start a container using our new image and invoke the Makefile with the target
platform.

```bash-session
host$ podman run -it --rm -v $PWD:/root kernel-factory:latest
container$ make MACHINE=<machine>
```

`<machine>` must be one of the supported platforms: `{boneblack,qemu}`

# Running Under QEMU

The `runqemu.sh` script is provided for convenience. This script forwards the
console on the target to the serial port `/dev/ttyS0`, which is backed by a
UNIX socket on the host. To connect to this serial port on the host, configure
`minicom(1)` or your serial terminal of choice to use the UNIX socket at
`${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/qemu-console.sock`.

# Booting the BeagleBone

The generated image should be `dd`-copied to an SD-card. By default, the
BeagleBone Black boot ROM will attempt to boot the on-board eMMC (MMC1) first.
To override this, use the boot select pushbutton (S2) to request that the boot
ROM try booting from the SD card first. The value of S2 is latched after POR,
so this switch must be pressed when power is applied to the processor, and the
setting will persist if the reset button (S1) is pushed.

Before booting, start the tftp and nfs services:

```bash-session
# modprobe nfsd
# docker-compose create
# docker-compose start
```

# Running with Nunchuk Emulator

Start the nunchuk emulator, then use the runqemu.sh script:

```bash-session
$ cargo run -- --socket-path ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/nunchuk.sock \
    --device-list i2c-0:52
# virtiofsd --socket-path ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/virtiofsd.sock \
    -o source=$ROOT_FILESYSTEM \
    -o cache=always
# chown root:$(id -g) ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/virtiofsd.sock
# chmod g+r,g+w ${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/virtiofsd.sock
$ ./runqemu.sh
```
